React JS is a web framework that is used to create a fast and interactive user interface for web and mobile applications. With this framework React creates an app that is visually appealing. It has been widely accepted by both developers for its easy learning curve and by companies for its SEO performance and its cross- platform operability. Today React is the most popular framework according to Stack Overflows data and has been adopted by industry tycoons like Netflix, Paypal, and Apple.</p>
